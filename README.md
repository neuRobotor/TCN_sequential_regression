Temporal Convolutional Network

TCN for predicting a behavioral output (EMG / kinematics) from neural recordigns.

Usage

python *_test.py This command will train a model with our default parameters, save the model, and print the cross-validated VAF in the reconstructed predictions. Default parameters can be seen in *_test.py.

Compatibility
Only works on Python 2.x, although most of it is Python 3.x compatible.
